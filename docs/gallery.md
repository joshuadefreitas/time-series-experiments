# Plot Gallery

This document links to selected plots generated by the experiments.  
All images are stored under `outputs/plots/` in the repository.

> Note: The exact filenames may change if you rename plots, but the structure should remain similar.

## 1. Trend and Seasonality

**File:** `trend_seasonal_sarima_vs_actual.png`  

![Trend + Seasonality (SARIMA)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshuadefreitas/time-series-experiments/main/outputs/plots/trend_seasonal_sarima_vs_actual.png)

Shows a synthetic series with trend + seasonality and SARIMA forecasts overlaid.

## 2. AR(1) Horizon Comparison

**File:** `ar1_h10_vs_actual.png`  

![AR(1) Horizon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshuadefreitas/time-series-experiments/main/outputs/plots/ar1_h10_vs_actual.png)

Illustrates how forecasts behave at a specific horizon for the AR(1) process.

## 3. Regime Switching Volatility

**File:** `regime_switching_mean_vs_actual.png`  

![Regime Switching](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshuadefreitas/time-series-experiments/main/outputs/plots/regime_switching_mean_vs_actual.png)

Shows how a simple mean forecast behaves under changing volatility regimes.

---

## 4. GARCH-like Volatility

**File:** `garch_mean_forecast.png`  

![GARCH-like Process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshuadefreitas/time-series-experiments/main/outputs/plots/garch_mean_forecast.png)

Displays synthetic returns and a mean forecast, highlighting the difficulty of predicting levels.

## 5. Structural Breaks

Example files (filenames may vary):

- `structural_break_global_mean.png`
- `structural_break_rolling_mean.png`
- `structural_break_global_arima.png`
- `structural_break_rolling_arima.png`

These plots show how global vs rolling models respond to a shift in the mean.

---

## 6. VAR(1) – Multivariate Forecasts

Example files:

- `var1_univariate_arima_y1.png`
- `var1_univariate_arima_y2.png`
- `var1_multivariate_y1.png`
- `var1_multivariate_y2.png`

These compare univariate ARIMA and VAR forecasts for each component.

---

## 7. Chaos – Logistic Map

Example files:

- `logistic_arima_h1.png`
- `logistic_arima_h5.png`
- `logistic_arima_h10.png`

These show forecasts of the logistic map at different horizons.

---

## 8. Chaos – Lorenz Attractor

**3D Attractor**

**File:** `lorenz_attractor.png`  

![Lorenz Attractor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshuadefreitas/time-series-experiments/main/outputs/plots/lorenz_attractor.png)

**Forecasts on x(t)**

Example files:

- `lorenz_x_arima_h1.png`
- `lorenz_x_arima_h5.png`
- `lorenz_x_arima_h10.png`

These plots show the Lorenz x-coordinate and ARIMA forecasts at different horizons.
