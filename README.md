A practical forecasting framework for exploring how different models behave under controlled time-series conditions. The focus is on understanding model behaviour — not just comparing metrics.

## Executive Summary (for Recruiters)

This project demonstrates core skills in forecasting, econometrics, and analytical data work. It highlights:

* Proper experimental design (rolling-origin validation)
* Ability to create and analyze controlled synthetic datasets
* Understanding of model behaviour under different data‑generating mechanisms
* Clean, modular Python architecture
* Skills relevant to finance, econometrics, and data analytics roles

It acts as a hands-on environment that shows practical forecasting competence.

## Purpose of the Project

This repository helps answer fundamental forecasting questions:

* When do simple models outperform complex ones?
* Why does horizon length matter so much?
* How do trend and seasonality change forecast difficulty?
* Why are financial returns nearly unforecastable?
* How do structural breaks affect all models?
* Can nonlinear or chaotic systems be forecast at all?

To explore these ideas, the framework includes:

* Controlled **synthetic simulators**
* Clean **rolling-origin evaluation**
* Reproducible **experiments** with interpretation
* Extensible architecture for future real datasets

## Current Capabilities

Below are the completed experiments that form the core of the project.

### **1. AR(1) Memory + Horizon Dependence**

Shows how predictive power decays with forecasting horizon.

### **2. Trend & Seasonality (SARIMA vs Baselines)**

Demonstrates the effect of explicit seasonal modeling.

### **3. Regime Switching (Variance Shifts)**

Illustrates that structure often lives in volatility, not levels.

### **4. GARCH-like Volatility Clustering**

Synthetic returns with volatility persistence; shows why predicting risk matters more than predicting direction.

Each experiment includes synthetic data generation, walk-forward evaluation, and interpretability.

## Roadmap (Upcoming Milestones)

### **Milestone 5 — Structural Breaks**

Mean shifts, changepoints, rolling-window adaptation.

### **Milestone 6 — Multivariate Forecasting (VAR)**

Cross-series interactions, impulse responses, stability.

### **Milestone 7 — Nonlinear Dynamics & Chaos**

Logistic maps, Lorenz system, horizons of predictability.

### **Phase 2 — Real Data Experiments**

Electricity demand, FX returns, macroeconomic indicators.

### **Phase 3 — Optional Live Forecasting Pipeline**

Automated ingestion + scheduled forecasts.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshuadefreitas/time-series-experiments.git
cd time-series-experiments
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running Experiments

Example:

```bash
python -m src.experiments.exp_ar1_horizons
```

All experiments:

* generate synthetic data
* run walk-forward evaluation
* compute MAE / RMSE / MAPE
* store plots
* print interpretation

---

## Methodology

### Rolling-Origin Evaluation (Walk-Forward)

Ensures temporal correctness and no leakage.

Steps:

1. Train on an initial window
2. Forecast ahead
3. Expand or slide window
4. Repeat

### Metrics

* **MAE** — average absolute error
* **RMSE** — penalizes large errors
* **MAPE** — percentage error (careful near zero)

---

## Why Start with Synthetic Data?

Synthetic data provides:

* Full control of the data-generating mechanism
* Insight into *why* models fail or succeed
* Clean experiments before touching real-world noise

Real data experiments will mirror these controlled scenarios.

---

## Dependencies

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* statsmodels

## How to Extend This Repository

This repository is designed to grow with you. Here are clear ways to expand it:

### **1. Add New Simulators**

Extend `simulators.py` with generators for:

* Nonlinear or chaotic systems
* State-space processes
* Cointegration / error-correction models
* Multi‑factor volatility processes

### **2. Add New Forecasting Models**

Add new functions to:

* `models_basic.py` (for heuristics/baselines)
* `models_arima.py` (for parametric time-series models)
* A new file for ML/DL models

### **3. Build New Experiments**

Each experiment lives in `src/experiments/` and follows a consistent pattern:

1. Generate or load data
2. Evaluate models with `rolling_forecast_origin`
3. Save plots to `outputs/plots`
4. Print interpretation and metrics

### **4. Add Real Data**

Place datasets in `data/real/` and replicate the synthetic experiments.

### **5. Optional: Live Forecasting Pipeline**

Later you can add:

* Data ingestion
* Automated model runs
* Scheduled daily forecasts
* Report or dashboard generation

This modular structure ensures long‑term maintainability.
